# Partial Derivative

Partial derivative is applicable for multivariable functions. Suppose we have the following function:

$$ f(x,y) = x^2y$$

The $\partial$ sign is used to denote that all other variables are constant. Hence,

$$ \frac{\partial f(x,y)}{\partial x} = 2x$$

, since $y$ is constant.

# Symmetry of Second Derivative

Technically, the symmetry of second derivatives is not always true. There is a theorem, referred to variously as Schwarz's theorem or Clairaut's theorem, which states that symmetry of second derivatives will always hold at a point if the second partial derivatives are continuous around that point. To really get into the meat of this, we'd need some real analysis.

You should keep in the back of your mind that exceptions exist, but the symmetry of second derivatives work for just about every "normal" looking function that you will come across.
