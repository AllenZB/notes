# Lagrange Multiplier

The Lagrange multiplier technique lets you find the maximum or minimum of a multivariable function $f(x,y,…)$ when there is some constraint on the input values you are allowed to use.

This technique only applies to constraints that look something like this: $g(x,y,…)=c$. Here, $g$ is another multivariable function with the same input space as $f$, and $c$ is some constant.

The core idea is to look for points where the contour lines of $f$ and $g$ are tangent to each other.
