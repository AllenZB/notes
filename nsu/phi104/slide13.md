# Virtue Ethics

Virtue ethics is a broad term for theories that emphasize the role of character and virtue in moral philosophy rather than either doing one’s duty or acting in order to bring about good consequences.

A virtue ethicist is likely to give you this kind of moral advice: “Act as a virtuous person would act in your situation.”

It may, initially, be identified as the one that emphasizes the virtues, or moral character, in contrast to the approach which emphasizes duties or rules (deontology) or that which emphasizes the consequences of actions (consequentialism).

# Three Direction

1. Eudaimonism
1. agent-based theories, and the ethics of
1. care

Eudaimonism bases virtues in human flourishing, where flourishing is equated with performing one’s distinctive function well.

An agent-based theory emphasizes that virtues are determined by common-sense intuitions that we as observers judge to be admirable traits in other people.

The third branch of virtue ethics, the ethics of care, was proposed predominately by feminist thinkers. It challenges the idea that ethics should focus solely on justice and autonomy; it argues that more feminine traits, such as caring and nurturing, should also be considered.
