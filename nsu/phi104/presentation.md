# Risk and Liability in Engineering

# 7.2 THE ENGINEER’S APPROACH TO RISK

## Risk as the Product of the Probability and Magnitude of Harm

The usual engineering definition of risk is
> "a compound measure of the probability and magnitude of adverse effect."

A relatively slight harm that is highly likely might constitute a greater risk to more people than a relatively large harm that is far less likely.

We can define a harm as an invasion or limitation of a person’s freedom or wellbeing.

## Utilitarianism and Acceptable Risk

> An acceptable risk is one in which the product of the probability and magnitude of the harm is equaled or exceeded by the product of the probability and magnitude of the benefit, and there is no other option where the product of the probability and magnitude of the benefit is substantially greater.

Basically it's acceptable if gain is more than risk and risk cannot be reduced anymore.

## Expanding the Engineering Account of Risk: The Capabilities Approach to Identifying Harm and Benefit

Capability focuses on the effect of disasters on overall human well-being. Well-being is defined in terms of individual capabilities, or "the ability of people to lead the kind of life they have reason to value."

**Problem with Utilitarianism**

a person with limited resources might learn to take pleasure in small things, which are only minimally satisfying to a person with more ample means. The individual in a poverty-stricken situation might have all of his or her severely limited desires satisfied. From the utilitarian standpoint, the person would be described as happy and be said to enjoy a high standard of living. Yet this individual might still be objectively deprived. The problem here is that utilitarianism does not take into account the number and quality of options that are available to individuals, which is precisely what capabilities capture.

From the capabilities standpoint, a risk is the probability that individuals’ capabilities might be reduced due to some hazard.

## "Risky" Situations and Acceptable Risk

## Free and Informed Consent

To give free and informed consent to the risks imposed by technology, three things are necessary. First, a person must not be coerced. Second, a person must have the relevant information. Third, a person must be rational and competent enough to evaluate the information.

First, it is difficult to know when consent is free. Have workers given their free consent when they continue to work at a plant with known safety hazards? Perhaps they have no alternative form of employment.

Second, people are often not adequately informed of dangers or do not evaluate them correctly.

Third, it is often not possible to obtain meaningful informed consent from individuals who are subject to risks from technology.

In light of the problems in getting free and informed consent, we could compensate individuals after the fact for actual harms done to them through technology.

This approach has the advantage that consent does not have to be obtained, but it also has several disadvantages. First, it does not tell us how to determine adequate compensation. Second, it limits the freedom of individuals because some people would never have consented. Third, sometimes there is no adequate compensation for a harm, as in the case of serious injury or death.

## Equity or Justice

> An acceptable risk is one in which (1) risk is assumed by free and informed consent, or properly compensated, and in which (2) risk is justly distributed, or properly compensated.

# 7.4 THE GOVERNMENT REGULATOR’S APPROACH TO RISK

> An acceptable risk is one in which protecting the public from harm has been weighted more heavily than benefiting the public.
