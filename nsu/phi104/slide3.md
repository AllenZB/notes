# Slide 3: The Development of Morality

Three stages in the development of morality:

1. The level of Instinct

    The conduct that appears right to the agent is the conduct determined by his fundamental needs and instinct-the innate tendencies.

1. The level of Custom
    The conduct that appears right to the agent is conduct in accordance with the customs of the group to which he belongs.

1. The level of Conscience
    The conduct that appears right to the agent is that approved by his own individual judgment of what is right and wrong.

# How was the primitive human society? Is there any morality?

Two views:

Man was naturally both free and good, it was a life of ideal peace, harmony, goodwill and happiness.

Every man feels by nature that he has a right to all things and as all are naturally acquisitive and ferocious, they are bound to be in a state of war with one another.

# Moral, Immoral, Amoral or non-moral

It is said to be neither moral nor immoral but amoral or non-moral, conduct to which moral predicates are not really applicable at all.

# Discussion on level of custom

Man considers to be right those forms of conduct which are approved by the standards or customary modes of behavior of the social group to which he belongs.

At this level, the bad action is the action that is “not done”, and the good action is the action that has been “always done” by the majority people.

# Discussion on level of conscience

At the level of conscience, the moral authority is inside the individual, it is an inner voice that directs him, and the commands of conscience appears the obvious and proper thing to do.

# Advancements

1. The standards of morality are now actively chosen by the individual after moral deliberation.
2. There is a new personal interest in morality.
3. Among other things including human welfare pure morality becomes the sphere of the individual.
