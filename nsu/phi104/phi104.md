# Ethics

# Definition

> **Ethics** is a branch of philosophy; it is moral philosophy or philosophical thinking about morality, moral problems and moral judgments.

>**Another definition**
We may define ethics as the normative science of the conduct of human beings living in societies-a science which judges this conduct to be right or wrong, to be good or bad, or in some similar way.

**Ethics differs from morals** and morality in that sense ethics denotes the theory of right action and the greater good, while morals indicate their practice.
