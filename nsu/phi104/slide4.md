# Slide 4: The Development of Ethical Theory

Three periods in the development of ethical theory:

In the Greek period the Greek city state formed the background of the moral life, and the man who performed his duties as a citizen was regarded as a good man.

In the Medieval period morality was dominated by the Church and, generally speaking, the good life was identified with the holy life or the religious life.

In the Modern period neither Church nor state are so important in the moral life , and morality is more concerned with the free individual and his rights and duties in relation to other free individuals.
