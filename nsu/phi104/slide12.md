# Kant’s Moral Law

There are three moral laws:

1. **"The formula of universal law"**: act only in accordance with that maxim through which you can at the same time will that it become a universal law.

1. **"The formula of humanity"**: So act that you use humanity, whether in your own person or in the person of any other, always at the same time as an end, never merely as a means.

1. **"The Principle of Kingdom of Ends"**: the noble ideal of a universal kingdom of ends in themselves (rational beings) to which we can belong as members only when we carefully conduct ourselves in accordance with maxims of freedom as if they were laws of nature.

Based on Kant’s formula of humanity, human life is sacred and inviolable, meaning one cannot enslave a few people even if it would enable more people to lead better lives. Killing one person to save the lives of millions is impermissible in Kantian ethics.
