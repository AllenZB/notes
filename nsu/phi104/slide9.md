# Slide 9: Utilitarianism Mill

1. Pleasure is the only thing that is desirable.
2. The only proof that a thing is desirable is the fact that people do actually desire it.
3. Each person’s own pleasure or happiness is a good to that person, so the general happiness is a good to everybody.
4. Men do desire other objects, but they desire them as a means to pleasure.
5. If one of two pleasures is preferred by those who are completely acquainted with both we are justified in saying that this preferred pleasure is superior in quality to the other.

# Limitations

1. The imperative to maximize happiness whenever possible is too strict. Should I buy milk for Africa rather than watching movie?
2. Sometimes maximizing happiness seems more than just right: jumping on grenade.
3. How are we supposed to calculate the utility for any given situation? We can’t predict the future, and even if we could, there are so many factors to most situations that it seems impossible for us to ever have a good idea of what the best possible consequence will be.
4. Utilitarianism seems to require us to do things that are not obviously morally permissible: Robin Hood.
