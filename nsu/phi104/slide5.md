# Slide 5: Autonomy

Autonomy in ethics refers to individual freedom or one's right to make decisions without being coerced. It is the concept of social, political and ethical morals that give individuals the rational right to make their own informed choices.

Autonomy means self-law, self-government, self-rule, or self-determination.

Personal autonomy is, at minimum, self-rule that is free from both controlling interference by others and from limitations, such as inadequate understanding, that prevent meaningful choice.

To be applied, the principle of autonomy must assume that you are free from the control of others and have the capacity to make your own life choices.

# Several senses of autonomy:

1. Autonomy as informed consent
2. Autonomy as confidentiality
3. Autonomy as Truth-telling
4. Autonomy as Fidelity
