# Slide 10: Deontological Ethics

The word deontology derives from the Greek words for duty (deon) and science (or study) of (logos).

In contemporary moral philosophy, deontology is one of those kinds of normative theories regarding which choices are morally required, forbidden, or permitted.

Deontology is against or in opposition to Consequentialism or utilitarianism.

Deontology do not use effects of action to judge action.

The most familiar forms of deontology holds that some choices cannot be justified by their effectsâ€”that no matter how morally good their consequences, some choices are morally forbidden.

For such deontologists, what makes a choice right is its conformity with a moral norm.

Such norms are to be simply obeyed by each moral agent; such norm-keepings are not to be maximized by each agent.

In this sense, for such deontologists, the Right is said to have priority over the Good.
