# Moral Philosophy

Moral philosophy is the philosophical thinking about moral terms, moral principles, moral judgments, moral language, what is morally good and bad, right and wrong.

# Types of Ethics

The word "ethics" is derived from the Greek "ethos" (meaning "custom" or "habit").

Ethics differs from morals and morality in that sense ethics denotes the theory of right action and the greater good, while morals indicate their practice.

There are 4 types of Ethics:

1. Normative ethics
1. Descriptive ethics
1. Metaethics
1. Applied ethics

# Normative Ethics

Normative Ethics (or Prescriptive Ethics) is the branch of ethics concerned with establishing how things should be, how to value them, which things are good or bad, and which actions are right or wrong. It attempts to develop a set of rules governing human conduct, or a set of norms for action.

Three main categories of normative ethics are:

1. Utilitarianism or Consequentialism: Consequentialism argues that the morality of an action is contingent on the action's outcome or result. Thus, a morally right action is one that produces a good outcome or consequence.
1. Deontology: Deontology is an approach to ethics that focuses on the rightness or wrongness of actions themselves, as opposed to the rightness or wrongness of the consequences of those actions. It argues that decisions should be made considering the factors of one's duties and other's rights (the Greek 'deon' means 'obligation' or 'duty').
1. Virtue ethics: virtue ethics focuses on the inherent character of a person rather than on the nature or consequences of specific actions performed.

# Other types

1. Descriptive Ethics is a value-free approach to ethics which examines ethics from the perspective of observations of actual choices made by moral agents in practice. It is mainly historical or anthropological.
1. Meta-Ethics is concerned primarily with the meaning of ethical judgments, and seeks to understand the nature of ethical properties, statements, attitudes, and judgments and how they may be supported or defended.
1. Applied Ethics is a discipline of philosophy that attempts to apply ethical theory to real-life situations. It is used in determining public policy.
