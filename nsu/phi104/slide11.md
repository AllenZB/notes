# Slide 11: Kantian Ethics

"the search for and establishment of the supreme principle of morality"

That supreme principle, which Kant calls the categorical imperative, commands simply that our actions should have the form of moral conduct; that is, that they should be derivable from universal principles.

# Moral Principles

In other words, Kant is going to start from our ordinary ways of thinking about morality and analyze them to discover the principle behind them.

# Good Will

A person who does the right thing for the right reason evinces what Kant calls a good will. A good will is the only thing to which we attribute "unconditional worth.â€œ

A number of the things which Kant says have only "conditional" value, such as health and happiness.

# Motive, not Result

When we attribute unconditional value to an action, it is because we have a certain conception of the motives from which the person acted.

So what gives a morally good action its special value is the motivation behind it, the principle on the basis of which it is chosen or, in Kantian terms, willed.

**Duty** is the good will.

# Criticism

One of the biggest criticisms of Kantian ethics is that it discounts outcome as a valid factor in evaluating the morality of an action.
