# L01: Introduction to Engineering Economics

What engineers do?
> Apply the principles of **science** and **mathematics** to develop **economical solutions** to **technical problems**

Design/Build/Test/Analyze/Develop/Innovate -> Services/Products/Plants/Process/Systems

Role of Engineers in Business: Create & Design -> Analyze -> Evaluate -> Repeat

Engineers manage **product life cycle**.  

## Rational Decision Making process

Decision Problem Recognition -> Define goal -> Collect Information -> Identify alternatives -> Select decision criteria -> Select best decision.

1. **Equipment Replacement Problem**: When is the right time to replace old equipments? How much should be replaced?
1. **New Product and Product Expansion**: Should new product be introduced to meet increased demand? Is it worth marketing new product?

## Future Prediction

1. Required investment
1. Manufacturing cost
1. Product demand
1. Selling price
1. Product life


## Fundamental Principles of Engineering Economics

1. A nearby dollar is worth more than a distant dollar
1. All it counts is the differences among alternatives
1. Marginal revenue must exceed marginal cost. Think at margin.
1. Additional risk is not taken without the expected additional return
1. People face trade-offs
1. Opportunity cost is included
1. People respond to incentives
1. Trade Can Make Everyone Better Off.
1. Markets are good organization of economic activity
1. Government can sometime improve market
1. The Standard of Living Depends on a Countryâ€™s Production
1. Prices Rise When the Government Prints Too Much Money
1. Society Faces a Short-run trade-off Between Inflation and Unemployment.

# L02: Production Economics

> Production is the process by which inputs are combined, transformed and turned into outputs.

## Firm

> A firm is an organization that comes into being when a person or a group of people decides to produce a good or service to meet a perceived demand.

Production is not limited to firm.

> **Perfect Competition**: It is an industry structure where there are **many firms** are producing **identical products** in which **no** firm is large enough to **control over prices**. New competitors can **freely enter/exit** the market.

Competitive firms are price takers.

Behavior of Profit-Maximizing Firms:
1. Amount of Output Supply
1. Production technology
1. Amount of Input demand

## Profit and Economic Costs

> **Profit** is the difference between total revenue and total cost.

> **Total Revenue** is the amount received from the sale of the product: $q \times p$.

> **Total Cost** is the sum of out-of-pocket cost, normal rate of return on capital and opportunity cost.

> **Normal rate of return** is a rate of return on capital that is sufficient to keep owners satisfied. Usually equal to bank interest.

> **Optimal method of production** is the method that minimizes cost.

## Short Run vs Long Run Decisions

|Short Run| Long Run|
|---------|---------|
|Operating under fixed scale| No fixed factor of production|
|Entry/Exit restricted| Entry/Exit open|

## Production Process

> **Production technology** refers to the quantitative relationship between inputs and outputs.

> A **labor-intensive technology** relies heavily on human labor instead of capital.

> A **capital-intensive technology** relies heavily on capital instead of human labor.

> The **production function** or **total product function** is a mathematical expression of a relationship between inputs and outputs. It shows units of total product as a function of units of inputs.

> **Marginal product** is the additional output that can be produced by adding one more unit of a specific input, e.g, marginal product of labor.

> **Average product** is the average amount produced by each unit of a variable factor of production.

> The **law of diminishing marginal returns** states that when additional units of a variable input are added to fixed inputs, the marginal product of the variable input declines.

> **Marginal product** is the slope of the total product function.

## Consumer and Producer Surplus

> **Consumer Surplus**: The difference between the price that a consumer is prepared to pay and the actual price paid.

> **Producer Surplus**: Difference between the market price received by the seller and the price they would have been prepared to supply at.
