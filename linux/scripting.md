# Shell Scripting

```sh

# There can be no space around "=" in var=value, otherwise (var = value) shell will think var is a command and try to execute it.

# Read input from standard input
read MY_NAME

# Concatenate stuff with variable
touch "${MY_NAME}_file"

# Test

`[[ ]]` is the extended test. It has less surprises. [Extended Test Manual](http://mywiki.wooledge.org/BashFAQ/031)

`< > != =` all these are string comparison. Use `-ge -gt -ne` flags for integer comparison.

```bash
# [ must be surrounded by space cause its a command
if  [ something ]; then
 echo "Something"
 elif [ something_else ]; then
   echo "Something else"
 else
   echo "None of the above"
