# Micro Service

> In short, the microservice architectural style is an approach to developing a single application as **a suite of small services**, each **running in its own process** and **communicating with lightweight mechanisms**, often an HTTP resource API. These services are built around business capabilities and independently deployable by fully automated deployment machinery.
