# Little Endian and Big Endian

Big Endian Byte Order: The most significant byte (the "big end") of the data is placed at the byte with the lowest address.

Little Endian Byte Order: The least significant byte (the "little end") of the data is placed at the byte with the lowest address.

Within a byte the order of the bits is the same for all computers (no matter how the bytes themselves are arranged).
